These firmware is for testing. Currently I haven't made GUI. I hardcode some-
- Gain total = 30%
- gain for each effect is 100%.
- PWM mode is H-Brigde (PE9, PE11)
- metric for conditional effect (damper, interia, friction)

based on your encoder choose correcponding to firmware

Please report issuses i will solve them as soon as possible.

I will find the way to create GUI and log report from STM32. currently I dont know how to made this :(.
